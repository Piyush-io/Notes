# Notes
This was supposed to be for my DSA journey, after completing a topic i used to type it in obsidian, in a manner like I was teaching somebody(Feynnman's Technique).
But I replaced it with actual note taking on pen and paper as it much more convinient.
So i think in here are the notes related to Sorting.
I wish i had continued doing it but I realised that it was too time consumnig and wasn't benifiting me that much.
