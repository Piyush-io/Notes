It is one of the simple sorting algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort.
- Its time complexity is O(N^2).
- It is an in-place and stable algorithm.

# Working

Insertion sort works on the principle of maintaining a sorted and an unsorted array. By traversing through the unsorted array and placing each element in its correct position in the already sorted array in each iteration we get a sorted array.
