Long time no see huh. Sorry i was a little busy watching Oppenheimer and taking a break for a while, but now we are back. I'm continuing with  Sorting today i want to reach 90% or even complete it today. I have already read my 10 pages from the book in fact I read 14 today, not a big deal but making up for lost time.
See you again tomorrow.
