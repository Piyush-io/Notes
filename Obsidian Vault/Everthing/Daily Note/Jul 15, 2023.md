So Hi. This is my first day using Obsidian.
I'm really excited about it.
Since its almost 7:30pm so i can just recap my day not start by writing down my todo things as we say it.
So I hope to resume C++ course right now.
I'll be starting [[Sorting]] today.
So i'll meet you or myself really tomorrow at 6 am maybe.
